# Prototyping for Desktop and Mobile

## Framer

* [Framer](http://framerjs.com), a prototyping tool for animation and interaction on desktop and mobile, free, JavaScript
* [Framer Generator ](http://framergenerator-update.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/archive/)
  * You need [Sketch Beta](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/beta/) for this to work
  * Your Sketch file needs to be saved (once) before you run Framer Generator
  * Multiple Pages are not supported. Use Artboards instead.
  * Multiple Artboards are supported, but only the first one will be visible. Youâ€™ll need to enable visibility in your code. For your convenience, the position for all Artboard is set to {0,0} on export, so you can easily use them for i.e: state switching.

### State Machine

> A new feature in Framer 3, the state machine is incredibly powerful and useful. It allows you to add multiple states to a layer. Think of a state as a set of one or more properties for the layer. A layer can have multiple states, you can add and remove them, and switch or animate between states. All of the states for a layer can have the same animation properties as well, such as the animation curve. You can access any state for a layer at any time. Layers also have a 'default' state as well, which are the properties of the layer at time of creation.
