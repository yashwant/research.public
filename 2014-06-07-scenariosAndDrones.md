# Scenarios & Drones

## Scenarios

* Patrol the perimeter of a property for intruders
* Monitor the precise weather at your location and automatically adjust the thermostat
* Watch for government Predators or other drones in the skies above a home
* Use advanced day and night cameras, a speaker, and a microphone to remotely communicate through the drone to a person standing nearby
* [Escort schoolchildren to a bus stop or school](http://www.digitaltrends.com/gadgets/quadcopter-camera-watches-kid/)
* Launch the drone by speaking to the house, "Computer, launch the drone"
* Delivering Mail and Packages: The Silicon vally start-up Matternet is already planning a massive interconnected drone delivery system for drugs and supplies in parts of the world where transportation is difficult. The next step would be adding speed to deliveries in developed countries by using drones. The technology is close, but legal restrictions must catch up. Example: [Matternet](http://matternet.us/)
* Waiting Tables: Getting to the more absurd and futuristic, but still very possible, we have automated restaurant waiters. In high end, high price restaurants, the personal touch of an actual waiter will likely always be desirable. But in lower cost, large table quantity places, an automated service system could increase speed and cut cost for owners. This idea is already in practice, but mostly for novelty’s sake. It will likely take a few years for full automation and reliability to become possible. And OK, although this one probably won’t save any lives, who doesn’t want to watch their food to float towards them.
