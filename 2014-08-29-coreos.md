# CoreOS

CoreOS is designed to be a modern, minimal base to build your platform. Consumes 40% less RAM on boot than an average Linux installation.

* [CoreOS website](https://coreos.com)
* [CoreOS documentation](https://coreos.com/docs/)

CoreOS runs on most cloud providers e.g. EC2, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine or virtualization platforms e.g. Vagrant, VMware, OpenStack, QEMU, KVM as well as bare metal servers e.g. PXE, iPXE, ISO, Installer.

## Definition

* Based on [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org)
* Kernel + Containers
* Comes with no package managers! If you want to run software, run it in a container
* Built for running HA clusters. Easily run application containers across multiple machines with fleet and connect them together with service discovery.
* Updates applied automatically – rolling release (though it is *not* ChromeOS/Chromium etc.). CoreOS utilizes an active/passive dual-partition scheme to update the OS as a single unit instead of package by package. This makes each update quick, reliable and able to be easily rolled back.
* read-only system(!)

## Omaha Protocol

* The updater is based on the Omaha Protocol
	* created by Google
	* Client / Server Update Protocol
	* Used to handle updates to products like ChromeOS, Chrome Browser & Google Earth
	* Open source bindings provided by CoreOS in Go – https://github.com/coreos/go-omaha
* it is a simple updater
	* client sends application id and current version to the update server
	* update server responds with the URL of an update to be applied
	* client downloads data, verifies hash & cryptographic signature, and applies the update
	* update exits with response code then reports the update to the update server
* it is polling **not** pushing, the client is in control
* avoid man in the middle or "rewind" attacks

### Core Components

* Application, that is going updated
* Group, instances that are related e.g. "all developers"
* Channel, is it "Alpha", "Beta", "Stable" software?
* Client/Updater
* Package

## Containers

* CoreOS supports [Docker](https://www.docker.com) + [nspawn](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html)
* Containers are isolated from other applications
* Containers have less overhead than VMs

## Services

### systemd

* [systemd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) is already used by Arch Linux, Core OS, Debian 8 "jessie", Fedora, openSUSE, RHEL, Sabayon, Ubuntu (planned)
* systemd is a system management daemon, it is your init system
* services, timers, and one-off jobs
* logging through journal/journald (e.g. syslog – CoreOS uses journalctl)

### etcd

**etcd** is a highly available key value store for shared configuration, service discovery, & distributed locking. It ships on every CoreOS instance.

* Key-Value Database
* Provides service discovery for cluster
* Similar to [Consul](http://www.consul.io) and [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org)
* command `etcdctl`
* Github: https://github.com/coreos/etcd
* etcd Dashboard: https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/mod/dashboard – Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_yeAx0l5T0

#### Locksmith

* Reboot manager for CoreOS
* Backed by etcd
* Works in tandem with *update-engine*
* Configurable strategies (on how your update happens) e.g.
	* *etcd-lock* – Reboot only after taking a succesful lock
	* *reboot* - reboot immediately without taking a lock
	* *best-effort* - If etcd is running, then use etcd-lock otherwise fall back to simple reboot
* Acts as lock coordinator for applications in a cluster
* command `locksmithctl`

### fleet

* Cluster-level service management
* Schedules jobs across cluster
* Reschedules units on failure
* command `fleetctl`
* Github: https://github.com/coreos/fleet

## Vagrant

* [Running CoreOS on Vagrant](https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/platforms/vagrant/)
* Github: [coreos/coreos-vagrant](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant). Minimal Vagrantfile for CoreOS.

## To Do

These are just some notes on what I should still embrace…

* The usage of **nspawn**, possibly for monitoring?
