# Twilio

* Twilio [Website](http://www.twilio.com/)
* Twilio [Developer Website](http://www.twilio.com/doers)
* Twilio [Documentation](http://www.twilio.com/docs)
* Twilio [Webinars](https://www.twilio.com/webinars)

## What is…

Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls and send and receive text messages using its web service APIs. Twilio's services are accessed over HTTP and are billed based on usage.

## Cost (example from UK), probably outdated (from 2012)

* A Twilio powered number costs $1 per month to rent.
* To send an SMS in the UK costs $0.04
* To receive an SMS costs $0.01
* To make an outbound call costs from $0.02 to a landline and $0.10 to mobile

So to run an outbound text message campaign to support a new album launch, hitting 100.000 fans would cost:

* Twilio number: $1
* Text messages: $0.04 x 100,000 = $4,000
* using an exchange rate of 0.77 campaign cost = £3,084

## Terms

### Technical

* **SMS**, **MMS**
* **VXML** ([VoiceXML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceXML)) is a digital document standard for specifying interactive media and voice dialogs between humans and computers.

### Marketing opportunities

* **Voicemail marketing**.  
Voicemail marketing emerged from the market prevalence of personal voice mailboxes, and business voicemail systems. Voicemail marketing presented a cost effective means by which to reach people directly, by voice. Abuse of consumer marketing applications of voicemail marketing resulted in an abundance of "voice-spam," and prompted many jurisdictions to pass laws regulating consumer voicemail marketing. More recently, businesses have utilized guided voicemail (an application where pre-recorded voicemails are guided by live callers) to accomplish personalized business-to-business marketing formerly reserved for telemarketing. Because guided voicemail is used to contact only businesses, it is exempt from Do Not Call regulations in place for other forms of voicemail marketing. Voicemail courier is a similar form of voicemail marketing with both business-to-business and business-to-consumer applications.
* **Mobile marketing**.  
Through mobile marketing, marketers engage with prospective customers and donors in an interactive manner through a mobile device or network, such as a cellphone, smartphone, or tablet. Types of mobile marketing messages include: SMS (short message service)—marketing communications are sent in the form of text messages, also known as texting. MMS (multi-media message service)—marketing communications are sent in the form of media messages.  
* **Mobile Applications**.  
Smartphone-based mobile apps contain several types of messages. **Push Notifications** are direct messages sent to a user either automatically or as part of a campaign. They include **transactional**, **marketing**, **geo-based**, and more. **Rich Push Notifications** are full HTML Push Notifications. Mobile apps also contain Interactive ads that appear inside the mobile application or app; Location-Based Marketing: marketing messages delivered directly to a mobile device based on the user's location; QR Codes (quick-response barcodes): This is a type of 2D barcode with an encoded link that can be accessed from a smartphone. This technology is increasingly being used for everything from special offers to product information. Mobile Banner Ads: Like standard banner ads for desktop Web pages but smaller to fit on mobile screens and run on the mobile content network

### "Young Guns" Case Study.

Twilio powered voicemail service. Fans call the Young Guns voicemail number, leave their message for the band, and call recordings are captured by Twilio. The calls are automatically transcribed by Twilio to provide call text and the MP3 recording of the call is passed to SoundCloud for hosting.

Fans can listen to each others messages, and Young Guns pick their favorite calls per week and give out prizes and call back fans directly for money can't buy experiences.

Fan recordings could easily be automatically posted into Artist Faceboo timelines or other social media platforms to extend the reach and community engagement.

### Get a phone call from your idols

Incentivize fans to sign up for services or make purchases to receive a call from their favorite artist. There are different ways to achieve this using Twilio. For example:

1. The artist pre-records a phone call and Twilio can be used to place an automated outbound call to the fan base at a pre determined time and date e.g. Christmas Day, fan Birthday. This call could be a personalised message, general update from the artist or include previews of new releases, etc.

2. The artist could place alive outbound call to interact directly with fans for additional wow factor. Using Twilio this call can be made anonymously so no caller ID is passed to the fan.

3. Create on the fly conference calls to bring multiple fans into the same phone call.

Twilio can also record the outbound call from the Artist to enable gifting the fan with a memento of their call, giving the fan the ultimate social currency and bragging rights with their friends.

### Offers and promotions via text message, like pre sales

Drive sales of new releases, tickets, merchandise via text message.  
5.9 million people actively use SMS in the world. That is 6 times higher than Facebook, 3 times higher than TV, 2.5 times higher than email.

**The average SMS message open rate is 5 times higher than email, with a 21% higher response rate vs. email. Amazingly on average SMS messages are opened 34,560 times faster than email. (5 seconds vs. 48 hours)** - very important for ticket sales for example.

Simply via Twilio you can deliver SMS messages containing links to your content or promotion. By using Bit.ly or similar services, you can also get full analytics on your campaign.

### Gig & venue interactivity
Capitalise on downtime at gigs and venues by offering interactive services, powered by Twilio numbers.

Often at venues the shear number of people or the nature of the venue make mobile data or venue WiFi impossible to use, rendering mobile apps useless. By creating services using text or voice you maximise the opportunity for people to engage without frustration.
Examples could be text to giant screen, song request to DJ, audience voting and polling, sign up to mailing lists, receive content, enter competitions.

### Mashups with other services
At its core, Twilio is simply an API.

This means it plays nice with any other service out there that also offers APIs. Combining Twilio with one or more services creates a world of possibilities.

For example:  
[Soundcloud phone call by Syd Lawerence](http://soundphone.syddev.com). Pick any recording hosted on Soundcloud amd make a Twilio powered call to any phone number you like, automatically playing that file over the call.

Spotify jukebox by Stevie Graham.  
Text in song requests to a Twilio number to automatically add that request to the Spotify play queue Perfect for public venues. Can be extended to allow people to vote up or down tracks in the play queue.

## Quotes & Notes

> The idea is that Twilio can perform the complex translation of different kind of calls or messages in the cloud. A regular phone call from a landline, a VoIP call from softphone client or a WebRTC call from a browser could all pass through Twilio’s application programming interfaces (APIs) and connect as a SIP-based call on an office extension. “Twilio sits in the middle, allowing you to mix and match all these forms of communication,” Schiavone said.
