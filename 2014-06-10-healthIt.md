# Health 2.0

## Needs

* By 2050, there will be more than 2 billion people aged over 60 or over
* Growing incidence of chronic diseases. Nearly 50% of US population by 2030.

## Products
The two dominant PHR platforms are **Microsoft HealthVault** and **Indivo X**. Google Health had been a dominant platform, but as of June 2011, **Google retired the Google Health project** and will no longer offer a PHR.

### Microsoft

#### Amalga
**Microsoft Amalga** (connected to Hospital Legacy System, Segment: Enterprise)  
Allows hospital enterprises to unlock the power of data sitting in clinical, financial, and administrative silos. Without replacing current systems, Amalga offers the ability to capture, consolidate, store, access, and quickly present data in meaningful ways. (Source: [Microsoft](http://www.slideshare.net/innerear/microsoft-health-vault))

#### HealthVault
**Microsoft HealthVault** (connected to Partner Applications, Segment: Consumer)  
Designed to put consumers in control of their health information. A HealthVault account helps you collect, store and share information with family members and gives you a choice of applications and devices to help manage your fitness, diet and health (Source: [Microsoft](http://www.slideshare.net/innerear/microsoft-health-vault))

HealthVault provides more than 80 granular data types that enable tracking data re- garding everything from daily exercise to genome sequences.

##### Sending Data to HealthVault

The "Share" page, among your user's profile, enables a link to HealthVault.

| Fitbit data | HealthVault data type | HealthVault field name |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Calories burned | Exercise | Calories burned |
| Steps Taken | Exercise | Number of steps |

| Fell asleep in | Sleep Session | Settling Minutes |
| Wake State | Sleep Session | Wake State |

For a bigger load of data extraction there is the [HealthVault Powershell (HvPosh)](https://github.com/vaibhavb/HvPosh). PowerShell can export data to a standard CSV format that can be consumed by a variety of other tools, simple or advanced that let you do calculations and generate charts.

##### Interfacing with HealthVault

* [The HealthVault Platform](https://platform.healthvault.com/platform/wildcat.ashx)
* [The HelathVault Shell](https://account.healthvault.com/signin?aip=True)

As of this writing, more than 80 types of devices connect with HealthVault. These devices range from pedometers and weighing scales to blood pressure meters and pulse oximeters.

**Continua**  
Continua Health Alliance is a nonprofit, open industry organization of health care and technology companies joining together to improve the quality of personal connected health care. With more than 230 member companies around the world, it is the leading consortium for personal health care devices.

**Applications**  

* [Mayo Clinic Health Manager](https://healthmanager.mayoclinic.com/), native HealthVault application
* [FitBit](http://www.fitbitcom) is a good example of an offline application. It links a FitBit account with a HealthVault user record and account, and then interacts with the health items therein.

### Indivo X

Indivo X is the latest iteration of one of the longest standing PHR development efforts in the world. Work on predecessors of Indivo date back to 1994. Both Google Health and HealthVault had the benefit of developing while the lessons and source code from early versions of Indivo were available. The industry regards the Indivo project as the grandfather of PHR systems.

The latest iteration of Indivo is called Indivo X, and is obviously a fourth-generation effort in the PHR arena. The genesis of the design made a tremendous splash with an perspective article in the [New England Journal of Medicine in 2009](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0900411).
